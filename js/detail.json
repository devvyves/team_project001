There is nothing around save for the soft, desert wind. You. Are. Free..From this defining vision was born SANTAL 33: a perfume that touches the vast and wild universality of this dream... that intoxicates... It combines a mix of cardamom and notes of iris and violet, which crackle in the form  ula. Added to this smoking wood alloy (Australian sandalwood, cedarwood) are some spicy, leathery, musky notes, giving this perfume its signature and addictive comforting scent."},

LYS 41 rewards those looking for a statement with an addictive floral buzz that is as potent as its wake and as insistent as the people following you around. Good luck."}

Tulips may not be the first flowers you would think of as being fragrant, but a number are definitely sweet-smelling. Byredo presents Tulipmania, a new hand care fragrance inspired by the historical phenomenon also known as “tulip fever”, a speculative frenzy over tulip bulbs. Almost ten years after launching La Tulipe (2010), a fresh perfume with floral notes conceived as an ode to spring, Byredo continues to explore the infinite potentialities of this silent smell. With a persistent base note of blonde woods and a flowery transparency accentuated by notes of freesia."}
