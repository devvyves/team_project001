            <h2>01 santal 33</h2>
            <P>
              Imagine sitting in solitude on the rugged, wide plains of
              the American West, firelight on your face, indigo-blue
              night skies above. There is nothing around save for the
              soft, desert wind. You. Are. Free.

              From this defining vision was born SANTAL 33: a
              perfume that touches the vast and wild universality of
              this dream... that intoxicates... It combines a mix of
              cardamom and notes of iris and violet, which crackle in
              the formula. Added to this smoking wood alloy
              (Australian sandalwood, cedarwood) are some spicy,
              leathery, musky notes, giving this perfume its signature
              and addictive comforting scent.
            </P>

            <h2>02 LYS 41</h2>
            <p>
              LYS 41 is an overwhelming white floral – a blend of
              jasmine, tuberose absolute, and lily, bewitching in its
              noble, warm, and sunny approach – yet treacherous once
              caught in its web of noble woods, vanilla Madagascar,
              and musks.

              LYS 41 rewards those looking for a statement with an
              addictive floral buzz that is as potent as its wake and as
              insistent as the people following you around. Good luck.
